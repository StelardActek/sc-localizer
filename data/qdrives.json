This long history also means that Juno parts and repairs are easy to come by.","ref":"d7cc897f-b760-4a73-93c0-27e23c52db0a","calculatorName":"JUST"}}},"localName":"qdrv_just_s03_vesta_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"qdrive","data":{"maxLifetimeHours":31.1,"type":"QuantumDrive","size":3,"grade":"C","name":"Wanderer","description":"Tarsus carefully designed and tuned the Wanderer into an all-around solid quantum drive, making it one of the more popular components in their revered line-up.","physics":{"mass":1400,"temperature":{"enable":true,"initialTemperature":-1,"coolingEqualizationMultiplier":false,"internalTemperatureGeneration":false,"signatureParams":{"enable":true,"minimumTemperatureForIR":250,"temperatureToIR":200},"itemResourceParams":{"minOperatingTemperature":0,"minCoolingTemperature":300,"enableOverheat":false,"overheatTemperature":600,"overheatWarningTemperature":450,"overheatRecoveryTemperature":430}}},"health":{"hp":1300,"damageResistanceMultiplier":{"physical":1,"energy":1,"distortion":1,"thermal":1,"biochemical":1,"stun":1}},"ref":"9e3ee84d-86f3-48f3-a4e0-e26899575c5b","distortion":{"decayDelay":4.5,"decayRate":1600,"maximum":8000,"warningRatio":0.75,"recoveryRatio":0,"powerRatioAtMaxDistortion":false,"powerChangeOnlyAtMaxDistortion":false},"resource":{"isResourceNetworked":true,"defaultPriority":50,"online":{"consumption":{"power":8,"cooling":8},"signatureParams":{"em":{"nominalSignature":30000,"decayRate":0.15},"ir":{"nominalSignature":0,"decayRate":0.15}},"consumptionMinimumFraction":0},"traveling":{"consumption":{"power":8,"qtFuel":26,"cooling":8},"signatureParams":{"em":{"nominalSignature":30000,"decayRate":0.15},"ir":{"nominalSignature":0,"decayRate":0.15}},"consumptionMinimumFraction":0}},"qdrive":{"quantumFuelRequirement":0.0644,"jumpRange":3.402823e+38,"disconnectRange":69893,"params":{"driveSpeed":246000000,"cooldownTime":10,"stageOneAccelRate":1800000,"stageTwoAccelRate":11600000,"engageSpeed":1500,"interdictionEffectTime":5,"calibrationRate":1000,"minCalibrationRequirement":5000,"maxCalibrationRequirement":10000,"calibrationProcessAngleLimit":5,"calibrationWarningAngleLimit":8,"calibrationDelayInSeconds":1.5,"spoolUpTime":7},"splineJumpParams":{"driveSpeed":400000,"cooldownTime":10,"stageOneAccelRate":250,"stageTwoAccelRate":50000,"engageSpeed":1500,"interdictionEffectTime":5,"calibrationRate":1000,"minCalibrationRequirement":5000,"maxCalibrationRequirement":10000,"calibrationProcessAngleLimit":5,"calibrationWarningAngleLimit":8,"calibrationDelayInSeconds":1.5,"spoolUpTime":7},"heatParams":{"preRampUpThermalEnergyDraw":12500,"rampUpThermalEnergyDraw":12500,"inFlightThermalEnergyDraw":12500,"rampDownThermalEnergyDraw":12500,"postRampDownThermalEnergyDraw":12500}},"class":"Civilian","manufacturerData":{"calculatorType":"manufacturer","data":{"nameSmall":"TARS","name":"Tarsus","description":"Founded by a pair of mechanics who were attempting to make an affordable module that would convert a quantum drive into a jump drive, Tarsus has evolved to become one of the main producers of dependable jump drives in the UEE.
